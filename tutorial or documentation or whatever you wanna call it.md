# Tutorial/Documention (idk wtf to call this)
This is just a place too put all the info needed to download/install, setup, and install this program. 
  ## Download/Install: 
  * Download the newest (or not newest) PYTOS release
  * Open PYTOS.exe
  * Create a login
  * Boom. It is that easy, unless you wanna run/open anything other than test.py and test.txt
  # Import your .py and .txt files:
There are 3 folders in the PYTOS folder (.internal, programs, files)

  ### .internal: 
  it just contains essential files for the program to work, so ignore it
    
  ### programs: 
  Your .py files go here.
  
  The "if __name__ == '__main__'" statement may not work due to the fact another program is opening it.
  
  So I made and used this template:
      
                  def prgmain():
                    Put code here
                  prgmain()
                  
  * If using a multiple .py file program:
    * it should not change anything, the programs list will look messy though (will fix in future update)
    
  ### files: 
  Your .txt files go here.
  
  Just throw your .txt files in the folder, simple.        


  ## How to use PYTOS
  *type the command "help" into the command/"What would you like to do?" line
    * This should appear: 

        'help' - Displays all valid commands
        'open program' or 'open app' - Gives a list of all programs and opens program user chose
        'open file' - Gives a list of all non-program files and opens file user chose
        'power off' or 'off' - Powers off OS"
  
  * Refer to this every time you forget a command

## Conclusion
You are now ready to use PYTOS (more like PYT(fake)OS)

If you are still having trouble:
  * Refer to the FAQ below

## FAQ:
Q: How do I run it?

A: Literally just open the .exe lol.

Q: How do I import my .py and .txt files?

A: Refer to tutorial/documentation.

Q: Do I need to make a login in the program?

A: For now, Yes. But probably not in the next update.

Q: Why?

A: Because I was bored and had no other ideas.

Q: What is the point of this?

A: idfk lmao, use it as a hub for your .py and .txt files i guess lol.

Q: MacOS/Linux/PieOS ports?

A: When I release the .py version, Yes (i'm gatekeeping it for now cuz it does not look neat lol). For now, windows only!

Q: Will this become an actual OS someday?

A: Maybe? idk. I literally have only ONE year of python programming class under my belt lol. It could possibly happen in later years when I have more experience with computer science as a whole.
