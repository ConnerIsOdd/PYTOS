# Python Text Operating System (simulation)
Simulation of what a VERY basic python text-based operating system would look like.

Can open .py and .txt files (again, VERY basic [and fake] OS [but, updates coming soon...])

Compatible with Windows only!
# Disclaimer
This is a SIMULATION, not a REAL operating system (it is a program you run on your already existing [Windows] OS)
# FAQ:
Q: How do I run it?

A: Literally just open the .exe lol.


Q: How do I import my .py and .txt files?

A: Refer to tutorial/documentation.


Q: Do I need to make a login in the program?

A: For now, Yes. But probably not in the next update.


Q:  Why did you make this?

A: Because I was bored and had no other ideas.


Q: What is the point of this?

A: idfk lmao, use it as a hub for your .py and .txt files i guess lol.


Q: MacOS/Linux/PieOS ports?

A: When I release the .py version, Yes (i'm gatekeeping it for now cuz it does not look neat lol). For now, windows only!


Q: Will this become an actual OS someday?

A: Maybe? idk. I literally have only ONE year of python programming class under my belt lol. It could possibly happen in later years when I have more experience with computer science as a whole.
